## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# to automatically format the code
npm run format
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Contributing

The code at the moment is still a bit messy, especially the code for handling different 'game modes'. Feel free to refactor, fix or add features.
